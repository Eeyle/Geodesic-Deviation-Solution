# Geodesic-Deviation-Solution
# Code by Scott Armstrong @imabearnose@gmail.com
# Analytical solution found as a group with Scott Armstrong, Hugo Maathuis, Nelson Reijers, and Ryan Sijstermans under the supervision of Prof. Gideon Koekoek.

This script simulates the analytical solution found by substituting a generic Taylor function into the differential equations of motion given by
the geodesic equation in the Schwarzschild metric in General Relativity. 
The analytical solution is compared to a numerical solution of the geodesic equations, and the error between the two is found. 
This analytical solution is the second confirmation that Prof. Koekoek's PhD Thesis is correct and reasonably accurate up to second-order deviations.


MATLAB instructions -
Run by section pro6.m in Matlab, with pro3.m and pro5.m in the same folder as it and included in the path. 
The different sections represent different scenarios with unique initial conditions and parameters.

R instructions -
Run by file any of the (n=0,1,2) /pro R/pro6-n.R files. These files represent different scenarios with unique initial conditions and parameters.
Optionally run /pro R/pro6-all.R in order to run all three scenarios in a single instance.
